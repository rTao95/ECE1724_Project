## Tentative Plan for Distributed File Storage System Project

### Week 1: Setup and Initial Implementation
- **Project Setup**
  - Initiate a Rust project repository with Git for version control.
  - Research and select libraries: Libp2p for networking, Diesel/SQLx for database.
  - Set up a local development environment to simulate nodes.

- **Node Discovery and P2P Networking**
  - Begin implementing Libp2p for peer-to-peer networking.
  - Implement node registration and discovery mechanisms.

- **File Chunking Setup**
  - Develop a module to break files into small chunks for distribution.

*Responsibility*: All team members collaborate initially to familiarize everyone with the codebase and Rust environment.

### Week 2: Core Functionality and Data Redundancy
- **File Distribution**
  - Implement distribution of file chunks across nodes.
  - Develop parallel upload/download methods for efficiency.

- **Data Redundancy and Monitoring**
  - Implement redundancy strategies like replication or erasure coding.
  - Establish monitoring processes for node health via the master node.

*Responsibility*:  
- **Developer A**: Focus on file distribution.
- **Developer B**: Implement redundancy mechanisms.
- **Developer C**: Develop monitoring features for node health.

### Week 3: Security and Master Node Enhancements
- **User Authentication and Access Control**
  - Build authentication methods for file operation security.
  - Implement role-based or user-specific access controls.

- **Master Node Coordination**
  - Enhance master node functions for node registration and metadata management.
  - Develop failover mechanisms to maintain reliable connections.

*Responsibility*:  
- **Developer A**: Security features.
- **Developer B**: Enhance master node functionalities.
- **Developer C**: Integrate failover mechanisms and test security.

### Week 4: Front-End Interface (CLI) and Testing
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
  - Develop a user-friendly CLI for file operations.
  - Integrate commands for uploading, downloading, and node health monitoring.

- **Testing and Optimization**
  - Conduct comprehensive testing and optimize for performance.
  - Address bugs and refine features.

*Responsibility*:  
- **Developer A**: Develop CLI.
- **Developer B**: Testing.
- **Developer C**: Optimize based on test results.

### Week 5: Finalization and Documentation
- **Documentation and Deployment**
  - Document setup, usage, and maintenance processes.
  - Prepare a final project presentation and demo.
  - Explore potential deployment on AWS for scalability.

*Responsibility*: All team members collaborate on documentation, finalization, and preparation for deployment.
